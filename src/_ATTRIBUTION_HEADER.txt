Author: Hasnaa Elidrissi
Date: 01 November 2025
Description: Code for downloading, preprocessing, and evaluating models on the
             GoEmotions dataset, including cross-lingual evaluations. The repo
             will compare full fine-tuning to PEFT (LoRA) with calibration and
             interpretability.
